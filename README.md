## Project Inspiration

In the midst of my journey to financial independence, Tom emerged as a guiding light to build my financial stability. He stepped in to offer financial counseling. His invaluable support and mentorship helped me to get through rigorous training and navigate financial obstacles on my path to becoming an engineer. Without a doubt, his steadfast encouragement propelled me forward.

I was inspired by his dedication to empowering others, particularly through financial stewardship and dedicated work. To commemorate his support, I designed 'TOMGET'‚Äîan AI-backed budgeting app crafted to aid individuals like myself in achieving financial stability and freedom.

Tom.Get support on a journey of growth and resilience, guided by Tom's wisdom and support.
